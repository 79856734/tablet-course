    I am Mostafa Mohamed from Dakahlia Governorate, I am in 1st Secondary and I am 15 years old. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Graphic Design on Photoshop. Of course, this is all thanks to -الله -سبحانه وتعالى, and the most important thing is a test for me. I would like to thank my father and mother who took care of teaching me from a young age to learn these skills and never denied me anything, all thanks to them after God. I would also like to thank all the YouTube teachers who gave up days of their time for very little money to help us, without Ahmed Mostafa's Photoshop course and Abdulrahman Jamal's coding course, I would not have been able to reach this point. I didn't make this website for fame or to advertise, I just wanted to benefit someone like me and make it easier to learn these skills on the tablet we all have.

  This website was programmed, designed, and uploaded completely from the government tablet. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the Spck editor because it's similar to working in Visual Studio Code, which I'm used to. The images were edited and designed in Photopea because it is similar to Photoshop. The site was uploaded to Github pages where the code is available to everyone.
